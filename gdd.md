# Game Design Document Outline

This game design document is a blueprint from wich a game is to be built. As such, every single detail necessary to build the game should be addressed. The larger the team and the longer the design and development cycle, the more critical is the need.


## 1. Title Page   
### 1.1. Game Name
Strategy (placeholder)
## 2. Game Overview
### 2.1. Game Concept
"Strategy" will be a strategy game set in the modern warfare.
### 2.2. Genre
TBS (Turn-bases strategy)
### 2.3. Target Audience
"Strategy" features war but won't feature gore and extreme violence. Suggested rating: +12
### 2.4. Game Flow Summary
"Strategy" will be a higly strategic game, meaning the user must think of all the alternatives and all the moves the opponent does. It will also feature a "twist" in gameplay: everyone can change the terrain to their heart's content, in order to help or prevent enemies from progressing further.
### 2.5. Look and Feel
"Strategy" will feature a low-poly art style, with vivid and colorful environments, enough to make the environment "fresh" but not from a fantasy world.
## 3. Gameplay and  Mechanics
### 3.1. Gameplay
#### 3.1.1. Game Progression
"Strategy" will feature a campaign (which includes tutorial), a "quick match" option and even multiplayer battles.
#### 3.1.2. Mission/challenge Structure
"Strategy" will test the player's abilities to control the battlefield in the least expensive way. It encourages overseeing the terrain at all times and thinking of all the paths the enemy can take.
#### 3.1.3. Puzzle Structure
"Strategy" won't feature puzzles.
#### 3.1.4. Objectives
"Strategy" encourages to defeat the enemy, either by destroying every unit of taking control of the enemy's stronghold.
#### 3.1.5. Play Flow
"Strategy" will play like a normal TBS game does. Expected match time will greatly vary, but expect short missions on campaign but full hour-matches on multiplayer.
### 3.2. Mechanics
#### 3.2.1. Physics
"Strategy" won't feature complex physics, mainly because that would depend on luck (eg: whether a portion of a bridge would collapse fully or partially).
#### 3.2.2. Movement in the game
Movement in "Strategy" is performed in squares, like typical TBS. The amount of movement a unit can do depens on it's own ability and the terrain.
#### 3.2.3. Objects
"Strategy" will feature resources on the battlefield that can be explored and help the player to deploy more units/buildings.
#### 3.2.4. Actions
"Strategy" allows units to move, fight, defend, set traps, build, etc...
#### 3.2.5. Combat
"Strategy"'s combat will follow a constant formula, predictable along the way, and features no luck.
#### 3.2.6. Economy
"Strategy" will emphasize player's moves, since most things cost money, which is a limited resource.
#### 3.2.7. Screen Flow
"Strategy" will allow the player to move the terrain across the screen.
#### 3.3. Game Options
"Strategy" has a campaign mode, a quick-match mode, a multiplayer mode and a level editor.
### 3.4. Replaying and Saving
"Strategy" will allow replaying on various maps so the player can learn more mechanics from it. It also allows saving a match to return to it later.
### 3.5. Cheats and Easter Eggs
"Strategy" won't feature cheats. Easter eggs yes.
## 4. Story, Setting and Character
### 4.1. Story and Narrative
The story is yet to be defined, but will follow the classic structure of you are the good guy, and someone decides to show up, destroy the entire land, and such. 
### 4.2. Game World
#### 4.2.1. General look and feel of world
The world will feature lots of polygon objects, the "low-poly" art style. However, it will look gorgeous.
#### 4.2.2. Areas
The world will feature continents and climateric changes.
### 4.3. Characters
There will be characters with special powers to use (decide on later)
## 5. Levels
### 5.1. Normal Levels
There are normal levels, either in a campaing or no.
### 5.2. Training Level
These type of levels will be tutorial-levels, featured in the campaign.
## 6. Interface
### 6.1. Visual System
The interface must look simple, be non-obtrusive, and mostly intuitive.
### 6.2. Control System
Controls will largely depend on mouse and keyboard combo. There will be hotkeys/shortcuts.
### 6.3. Audio, music, sound effects
The audio is this game will match the art style (decide on later)
### 6.4. Help System
There will be an "encyclopedia" inside the game, explaining every important detail the user must know.
## 7. Artificial Intelligence
### 7.1. Opponent and Enemy AI
Enemy AI will be a though challenge, but I imagine it being smart.
### 7.2. Non-combat and Friendly Characters
During the game, you may receive help messages from your comrades, but you're all by yourself: the choices are yours.
### 7.3. Support AI
No support AI.
## 8. Technical 
### 8.1. Target Hardware
"Strategy" is targeted to run on low-end PC's. A mobile port is in the idea's notebook. Console ports are not viable by now (due to money contraints and Java)
### 8.2. Development hardware and software (including Game Engine)
"Strategy"'s 3D engine will be jMonkeyEngine.
### 8.3. Network requirements
"Strategy" will have a mupltiplayer mode, which is not intensive. So, a slow internet connection works perfectly.
## 9. Game Art
"Strategy" will have a "low-poly" art style.
